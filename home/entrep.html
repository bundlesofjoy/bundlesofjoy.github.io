                Bundles of Joy is a start-up business run by a group of six Grade 12 STEM students of Pasig City Science High School (PCSHS). The company envisions to become the most convenient food company for every Filipino that satisfies their food cravings through high quality, tasty, and budget-friendly products. With this, its central mission is to cater the trendy food cravings of their customers with its wide variety of sweet and savory food choices in a food bundle. </br>
                </br>
                Bundles of Joy offers customizable food bundle sets that can also be sold separately according to the customers' preferences. Most of the food variety that the company includes in their menu are the ones that most of the people crave or want to try whenever they encounter it through their social media accounts such as TikTok and Facebook.

Bundles of Joy's main target market are teenagers and young adults; however, the company is also perfect for the general public as well as the best food brings out everyone's best mood.</br>
                </br>
                Based on the data gathered, the five existing popular competitors are not able to meet the demand of the market due to demand increase as well as lack of food varieties since 4 out of the 5 competitors focus on sweet products. This means that the demand of customers and the demand with the food varieties were not met and due to this concern,  Bundles of Joy were created. Facebook is used as the main platform in promoting the products and bundles. Other digital applications such as Messenger and Google Forms are utilized for inquiries concerning availing the products especially for customization of bundles. This includes the instructions and information regarding the order and delivery process. Only limited slots are available since the group wants to make sure the food’s quality remains fresh. Moreover, to improve the market strategy and to cope up to the consumers demand, Bundles of joy are open to gather suggestions and recommendations to accommodate the majority of our target market. The main goal of this business is to provide quality and convenient experience to the consumers by presenting affordability and good quality products. Bundles of Joy’s greatest advantage from its competitors is it offers a large variety of food choices at a budget-friendly price and its eco-friendly packaging. </br>
                </br>
                The starting capital of the company is ₱10,701.85 . Assuming that there will be 216 orders within a week and there will be an 15% weekly increase in orders, the ending cash balance on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th week will be ₱12,122.71, ₱13,941.12, ₱16,032.29, and ₱18,437.13, respectively. In conclusion, the company could make a net profit of ₱7,094.88 in its first week from their products with a starting capital of ₱10,701.85. </br>

The menu and order form will be posted on Facebook so the customers could see the actual product selection they could choose from and order it online for easier transaction. The company will only accept pre orders and the order form will only be open every Monday to Friday until 12 PM to give ample time for the production team to buy the raw materials and prepare the orders needed to be delivered every Sunday. The customers can choose from the wide variety of modes of delivery offered by the company such as pick up/meet up in Lucky Gold Plaza or Lifehomes in Rosario, Pasig City, bike delivery offered by the company, and the same day delivery couriers such as Lalamove and Grab. The delivery fee except for pick up/meet up will be shouldered by the customers. The customers would also have the freedom to pick their chosen mode of payment such as online payment such as GCash or Paymaya or cash-on-delivery provided that they will submit one (1) valid ID for verification purpose.</br>
